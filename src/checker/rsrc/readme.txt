"Read me isn't my passion"

BINCHECK.DLL Demo Test
======================

Version : v1.0
Autor   : [big_fury]SiZiOUS a.k.a SiZ!
Website : http://sbibuilder.shorturl.com/

I) Presentation : 
-----------------

Hello everyone! This program was made to test the new BINCHECK.DLL Delphi port
from LyingWake' Visual Basic source code. It'll NOT remplace the original 1st_read.bin
Checker, because it's very limited, it can only detect the bin state (yeah, yeah, that's it),
and scramble / unscramble the target file. Nothing else.

II) Use : 
---------

Run the software. Click the browse button to pick your binary. After that, just click the
"Test !" button. If you want you can Scramble/Unscramble the selected binary, for that just
click on Scramble/Unscramble buttons.

That's it :P

III) Credits : 
--------------

This app was programmed by [big_fury]SiZiOUS (SiZ!). 
It is freeware and can be distributed, if you keep the original package.
Original BINCHECK.DLL source code from LyingWake.

Enjoy it !!!

SiZ!
